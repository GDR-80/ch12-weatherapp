# CH-12 Weather Project

---

## About the project

This is my final piece of homework from [The Jump's](https://www.thejump.tech/) vanilla javascript module on their full stack developer bootcamp course.

I was tasked to create a simple weather application that gets data from an api and manipulates the DOM using vanilla javascript to display the data on the screen.

## What the app does

The app uses geolocation to get a users current location and displays the weather for where they are. There is an input box where a user can search for a place; this then returns the weather for the location searched.

The app gives the user the current weather, the days forecast in 3 hourly intervals and also a daily forecast for the following 5 days.

Other features include the background changing colour depending on the weather conditions.
